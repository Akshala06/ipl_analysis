# ipl_analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) match data to identify team performance, player consistency, and match-winning factors. Using statistical and data analysis techniques, insights were drawn from parameters like runs scored, wickets taken, toss impact, and venue influence. 


🏏 IPL Analysis and Dashboard Creation

📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) match data using Data Visualization and Analytics (DVA) techniques.
The system processes historical IPL datasets to identify patterns in team performance, toss decisions, venue impact, and match outcomes.
An interactive dashboard is created to visually present insights and predict match results using machine learning.
